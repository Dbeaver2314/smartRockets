      Smart Rockets is an example of a basic genetic algorithim. the "rockets"
      can move in four directions with their input being random. if a rocket
      strikes a wall ,or red line it stops and "dies". each cycle rockets can
      randomly breed to pass on their genetics. Rockets who live longer, or make
      it to the green target have a higher chance to pass on their good
      genetics. overtime their movement becomes less chaotic, and more rockets
      reach the target.
